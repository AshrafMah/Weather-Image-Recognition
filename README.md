# Weather Image Recognition

Weather Image Recognition is a project designed to classify weather conditions from images using machine learning techniques. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 95% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting various weather phenomena.

## Overview

Weather Image Recognition utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately classify different weather conditions based on input images. With a diverse dataset covering a wide range of weather phenomena, the model can reliably predict the weather depicted in the images.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises images representing various weather conditions, each labeled with one of the following classes:

- **0: Dew**
- **1: Fog/Smog**
- **2: Frost**
- **3: Glaze**
- **4: Hail**
- **5: Lightning**
- **6: Rain**
- **7: Rainbow**
- **8: Rime**
- **9: Sandstorm**
- **10: Snow**

## Model Performance

The deployed model achieves an impressive test accuracy of 95%, indicating its robustness in classifying weather conditions from images. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score have been employed to assess the model's classification performance.

## Deployment

The model is deployed using a Flask web application, offering a user-friendly interface for weather classification. Users can conveniently upload images, and the application will predict the corresponding weather condition.

### Instructions for Deployment:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Flask and other necessary dependencies are installed.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. **Run Application**: Run the Flask application locally or deploy it on a web server to make it accessible to users.

## Future Improvements

Several enhancements are envisioned for this project to further improve its capabilities and user experience:

- **Model Architecture Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the model architecture to enhance accuracy even further.
- **Real-Time Weather Detection**: Integrate support for real-time weather detection using live camera feeds, enabling users to identify current weather conditions.
- **User Feedback Incorporation**: Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to continually refine the model's predictions and enhance its performance over time.
